1. Introduction
Public transport is an integral part of everyday travel in Sri Lanka, with millions relying on
trains, buses, and other transportation services. The National Transport Commission (NTC)
states that about 1.5 million people travel by train every day, and more than 90% of passengers
travel by road-based transport such as buses and private vehicles. This excessive dependence
on road transportation has generated high traffic levels, especially in highly populated urban
centers like Colombo. The heightened pace of private car ownership has also led to heightened
air pollution, carbon emissions, and inefficient fuel consumption. As cities keep on growing, it
is a necessity to make public transportation more efficient and promote a switch to rail
transport.
Train travel has been identified as a fast and green mode of transportation with high capacities
to transport people that can travel with far less emission per kilometer compared to road
transportation. Trains alleviate congestion in road traffic, improve fuel efficiency, and provide
enhanced safety for commuters. But Sri Lanka's railway network is challenged by issues of
uncertainty in timetabling and real-time location. Delays in trains caused by infrastructural
constraints, operational inefficiencies, climatic conditions, and technical problems
inconvenience commuters with longer waiting time and uncertain travel plans. More accurate
arrival prediction of trains and real-time tracking would enable smoother commuter experience
and attract a modal shift to rail transportation.
To respond to these issues, Sri Lanka introduced RDMNS.LK, an online and mobile-based
train scheduling and tracking system that offers train timetables and real-time updates
(RDMNS.LK,2024). The RDMNS.LK system sources crowdsourced information from users
of its mobile application, which enables the tracking of the movement of trains in real-time in
addition to occupancy by travelers. The system improves the passenger experience as it
provides real-time information about train positions and travel conditions. Nevertheless,
RDMNS.LK does not utilize predictive analytics at present, i.e., it does not automatically
generate arrival time predictions or delay alerts based on real-time conditions such as
congestion, mechanical breakdown, or adverse weather. Incorporating predictive models using
machine learning can enhance the accuracy of arrival times, decrease uncertainty, and increase
railway efficiency.

Recent research has shown that machine learning has the potential to greatly improve rail
efficiency. Numerous predictive models like k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), moving averages
(Pongnumkul et al., 2014), Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) models (Pichardo Vicencio,
2024), and Random Forest Regression (Kosolsombat & Limprasert,2017) have been employed
in predicting train delays with growing accuracy. By integrating these cutting-edge data-driven
technologies in Sri Lanka's rail network, arrival time predictions can be enhanced, resulting in
better scheduling and enhanced passenger experience.
Enhancing Sri Lanka's railway network with predictive analytics and real-time monitoring will
not just improve railway operations but also have wider societal advantages. Promoting the
utilization of rail over road transportation will decrease traffic congestion, environmental
footprint, and enhance sustainable city growth. Further, an efficiently running railway system
has the potential to improve economic productivity through effective transportation of
individuals and commodities, enhancing labor mobility and national infrastructure (Zhang et
al., 2019).
With the incorporation of machine learning-based predictive analytics in the railway system of
Sri Lanka, train timetables can be made more efficient, reliable, and commuter-friendly. This
will allow passengers to plan their trip more assuredly, without uncertainty about travel. With
more commuters traveling by rail than road transport, Sri Lanka's cities will experience less
traffic congestion, lower carbon emissions, and better air quality. Lastly, a smart railway system
will result in a green, economically successful, and sustainable society.
2. Problem Statement
Sri Lankan Railways depend on manual observation and fixed timetables without effective
real-time train arrival predictions. This results in passenger dissatisfaction, operational
inefficiencies, and low public transport confidence. This project seeks to address these
problems by applying machine learning to provide accurate predictions of train arrival times,
enhancing efficiency, reliability, and commuter experience.

3. Aims and Objectives
Aim:
To develop a real-time train tracking and arrival time prediction system for Sri Lanka using
machine learning to improve accuracy and enhance customer satisfaction.
Objectives:
• To assess the effectiveness and reliability of existing railway tracking applications.
• To identify and analyze recent technologies in railway tracking.
• To develop machine learning models for accurate train arrival time prediction.
4. Literature Review
The prediction of train arrival times and real-time railway tracking has gained significant
attention due to the need for improved passenger experience, optimized railway operations,
and enhanced transportation efficiency. Recent research explores Machine Learning (ML)
techniques to address these challenges, yet gaps remain in their practical implementation,
particularly in developing countries like Sri Lanka.
ML models have been widely used in railway systems to enhance scheduling accuracy. Vafaei
and Yaghini (2024) propose Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Gradient
Boosting Regression (GBoost), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models to predict
train arrival times. Their study, based on historical data from the Tehran-Mashhad railway,
demonstrates that ML improves scheduling accuracy and reduces delays. However, the
approach is heavily reliant on extensive high-quality datasets, which may not be readily
available in developing railway networks.
Beyond prediction models, real-time tracking has been explored to improve train monitoring.
Zhang et al. (2019) introduce a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for train number tracking,
mitigating uncertainties in signaling and scheduling data. Their study highlights the
significance of real-time information integration but does not fully address disruptions caused
by unpredictable factors such as weather or maintenance. The challenge lies in dynamically
updating predictions based on live data, which remains an area of further research.

The availability of railway datasets is another crucial aspect influencing ML applications.
Pappaterra et al. (2021) review publicly available datasets for AI-driven railway applications,
finding that while traffic planning and maintenance datasets are abundant, those related to real-
time tracking and transport policy are scarce. This limitation constrains the development of
generalizable ML models, especially for countries with outdated railway infrastructure.
Despite these contributions, challenges persist in applying ML models to railway networks with
inconsistent data collection. Vafaei and Yaghini (2024) show ML effectiveness in structured
networks, but the applicability to Sri Lanka, with outdated infrastructure and irregular
scheduling, remains uncertain. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2019) emphasize real-time tracking,
yet their model relies mainly on historical data, limiting its effectiveness in handling sudden
disruptions. The lack of well-documented datasets, as highlighted by Pappaterra et al. (2021),
further complicates ML model development for railway systems.
While most studies focus on technologically advanced railway networks in developed
countries, limited research examines how ML techniques can be adapted to smaller, less
advanced railway systems. The integration of ML-based predictions with real-time data is
another research gap, as most models depend on historical data rather than dynamic updates.
Additionally, dataset scarcity remains a significant barrier, limiting collaborative research and
practical implementation in underdeveloped railway networks.
Building on this foundation, the proposed research aims to develop a real-time railway tracking
and arrival time prediction system tailored to Sri Lanka’s railway network. This study applies
ML models such as ANN, RF, GBoost, and XGBoost, extending the work of Vafaei and Yaghini
(2024) by incorporating real-time data sources, including train location updates and track
status, to enhance predictive accuracy.
Furthermore, this research expands on Zhang et al. (2019) by designing a train tracking
mechanism that dynamically updates train locations and mitigates real-time uncertainties in Sri
Lanka’s railway system. By integrating diverse data inputs, the proposed system enhances train
tracking and prediction accuracy in environments with frequent schedule disruptions.
To address dataset scarcity, this current study will collect and curate a comprehensive dataset
specific to Sri Lanka’s railway network, combining historical and real-time data. By developing
an accessible dataset, this research contributes to future studies on railway tracking and ML
applications in transportation.

To summarize, while ML has shown promise in railway tracking and arrival time prediction,
critical gaps remain in real-time data integration, dataset availability, and the applicability of
ML techniques to developing railway systems. This study seeks to bridge these gaps by
incorporating ML techniques with live data streams to enhance prediction accuracy and railway
efficiency in Sri Lanka.
